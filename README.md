# Raining_Environment
In the months between February and May 2024, I was grateful to participate in the Inclusive Internationalization BIP and the joined 11th International Week (3rd ATHENA International Week) in the city of Chania, island of Crete in Greece.
During these 4 months, I was able to be part of an international team of students from diverse universities throughout Europe and the world.
My team, along with the help of child and occupational therapists, looked to develop a tool in the form of a virtual reality experience to help people on the autism spectrum, especially children and teens, face stressful situations in a controlled and accompanied way.
Developed in Unity and for use with VR headsets, the experience provided the therapists with virtual environments like a supermarket and parks, and with them the option to change variables like the number of people and noise around the person with the glasses, allowing the person responsible to follow along and guide the user through what might be a stressful experience for them.
Finishing with a successful business pitch presentation, was a project I was very glad to be a part of.
This experience helped me sharpen my communication skills having to remotely work with a team of different students and my Unity skills, VR experiences, and game development.
